# Retention Lens

A churn analysis website built from `Churn_Modelling.csv` (10,000 bank customers).

- Backend: Python and Flask (`app.py`). The analysis uses only the standard library, so pandas is not needed.
- Front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js (`static/`)

## Run it

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows (Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser. You need an internet connection so the
page can load Chart.js and the fonts.
